## Architecture

The Clean Architecture Stock Market App follows a modular and layered architecture for separation of concerns and maintainability. It consists of the following layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: This layer contains the Jetpack Compose UI components, view models, and screens for displaying data to the user and handling user interactions.
- **Domain Layer**: The domain layer contains business logic and use cases. It defines the core functionality of the app, independent of any specific framework or implementation.
- **Data Layer**: The data layer handles data retrieval and storage. It includes repositories, data sources, and cache mechanisms. It abstracts the data access implementation from the domain layer.

The app also incorporates dependency injection and inversion of control principles to ensure loose coupling between the layers and facilitate testability and maintainability.

## Requirements

- Android device or emulator running Android X or higher.
- Internet connection to fetch real-time stock market data.
